# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data
The purpose of the script was to clean the data that was collected from the accelerometers from the Sansung Galaxy S smartphone. The data set can be found here: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones The steps to clean them included:
   1. Merging the training and the test sets to create one data set.

   2. Extracting only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 

   3. Using descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

   4. Appropriately labeling the data set with descriptive variable names. 

   5. From the data set in step 4, creating a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
